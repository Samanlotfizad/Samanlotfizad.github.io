title: Self-Leveling Anteater Project (SLAP)
description:   
  I am responsible for mechanical fabrication and prototyping for SLAP, including
  3D printing PLA components for the initial prototype and assisting with full system
  assembly. With the core mechanical design finalized, the final iteration will
  transition to primarily machined aluminum components using 5052 and 6061 alloys
  for improved structural performance and durability.
skills: 
  - Solidworks
  - 3D Printing
  - Aluminum components (5052, 6061)
