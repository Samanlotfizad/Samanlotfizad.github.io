title: Beach Cleanup Rover
description:  Leading the mechanical design of a 3D-printed, four-wheel-drive beach cleanup rover focused on litter collection and environmental sustainability. Designed a tracked drivetrain driven by four independent motors using a gear-and-sprocket transmission system, optimized for traction and load distribution in sandy terrain. Responsible for mechanical design and integration of the drivetrain, scooping mechanism, and vibration-based sand-sifting system in SolidWorks. Selected PLA for low-load structural components and PETG for higher-load parts such as gears and sprockets. Collaborating with electrical and software teammates to integrate motors, sensors, and an AI-enabled camera system for future autonomous operation.
